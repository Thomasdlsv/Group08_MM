### Welcome to our project repository!

## How to run the code
* To run the application, you either run the jar ``SailingSimulator.jar`` via the cli, or you navigate to the class ``App.java`` and execute its main method in your favorite IDE. You may need to build the gradle project first.
* The boat can be controlled by the left and right arrow keys, the sail can be controlled by the up and down arrow keys.
* To run the experiments, you can have a look into the ``com.sailing.experiments`` package and execute the main methods.
* To get insights into the results generated from the experiments, you can have a look into the Jupyter Notebooks that are located next to the experiment classes. 
* To open the java documentation, open the file ``doc/index.html`` in your favorite browser.
